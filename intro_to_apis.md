# What Are APIs?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow two digital systems to communicate. When you open a weather app, send a text, or check sports scores, APIs are working behind the scenes.

APIs exchange data using structured formats such as JSON.

## Example  
A typical API response might look like:

```json
{
  "temperature": 72,
  "condition": "Sunny"
}

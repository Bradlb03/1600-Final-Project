# Making Your First API Request

You will use a browser or a tool like curl/Postman to request data from a public API.

Use the "Dog API," which returns a random photo of a dog:  
`https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`

---

## Step 2: Make the Request  
Open the URL in a browser or run:

```bash
curl https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
```

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are common problems when interacting with APIs:

---

## 1. The API URL Doesn’t Load  
Check your internet connection or verify the URL is correct.

## 2. You Get an Error Code  
Example:  
- 404 means the resource doesn’t exist  
- 500 means the server had an issue

## 3. Response Looks Messy  
Use a JSON formatter or your browser’s built-in viewer.
